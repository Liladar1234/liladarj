## 🛠️ Projects

### Project 1: Patient Symptom Analysis System
This project focuses on designing a patient symptom analysis system to address challenges in symptom reporting, medical awareness, and accessibility. The goal is to help patients, doctors, and administrators analyze and manage symptoms effectively to determine severity levels and provide appropriate recommendations.

#### Problem Identification
- Inconsistent symptom reporting leading to ambiguous assessments.
- Lack of medical awareness, causing delays in medical intervention.
- Limited access to medical advice in remote areas.
- Risks of self-diagnosis based on unreliable resources.
- Difficulty in differentiating overlapping symptoms.
- Language and accessibility barriers hindering effective reporting.

#### Motivation
- Improved health outcomes through early identification of symptoms.
- Increased accessibility for underserved areas, reducing disparities.
- Optimized healthcare resource allocation by prioritizing severity.

#### Problem Definition
Designing a system to analyze patient symptoms, clarify severity, and provide solutions or recommendations using efficient algorithms and data structures.

#### Algorithms Used
- Linear Search
- Quick Sort
- KMP algorithm

#### Modules and Functions
- **Patient Module**
- **Analysis Module**
- **Diagnosis Module**

#### Data Structures Used
- **Unordered Map**: Map symptoms to possible diseases
- **Vector**
